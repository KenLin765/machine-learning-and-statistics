# Machine Learning and Statistics

by Kenneth Linehan

## About

This repository is for a module called Machine Learning And Statistics, which I studied at ATU at Winter 2023. The module consists of 5 tasks, which were based on 4 of the subjects which we looked at.

These subjects are:
1. Chi-Square Tests
2. t-Tests
3. k Nearest Neighbours
4. Preprocessing

## Project Question

- The project is to create a notebook exploring classification algorithms applied on the iris flower data set associated with Ronald A Fisher.

- In your notebook, you should first explain what supervised learning is and then explain what classification algorithms are.

- Describe at least one common classification algorithm and implement it using the scikit-learn Python library.

- Throughout your notebook, use appropriate plots, mathematical notation, and diagrams to explain the relevant concepts
