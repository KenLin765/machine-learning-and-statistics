# Machine Learning and Statistics

Winter 2023/24

**Author:** Kenneth Linehan

## About

This repository contains materials related to the "Machine Learning and Statistics" module I studied at ATU during Winter 2023. The module is structured around five tasks, each focusing on one of the following subjects:

1. Chi-Square Tests
2. t-Tests
3. k Nearest Neighbours
4. Preprocessing

## Project Question

- The project involves creating a notebook exploring classification algorithms applied to the iris flower dataset associated with Ronald A. Fisher.
- The notebook covers explanations of supervised learning, classification algorithms, and the implementation of at least one common classification algorithm using the scikit-learn Python library.
- Throughout the notebook, appropriate plots, mathematical notation, and diagrams are used to explain relevant concepts.

## Tasks Questions

### 1. Square Roots Approximation
- Implement a square root approximation function `sqrt(x)` using Newtonâ€™s method.
- Start with an initial guess \(z_0\) and iteratively improve it until the difference between consecutive guesses is less than a threshold.

### 2. Chi-Squared Test
- Conduct a chi-squared test on a contingency table regarding preferences for coffee or tea and plain or chocolate biscuits.

### 3. T-Test on Penguins Data
- Perform a t-test on the famous penguins dataset to investigate the body mass difference between male and female gentoo penguins.

### 4. Iris Dataset Analysis
- Analyze the famous iris dataset and suggest whether the setosa class is easily separable from the other two classes.

### 5. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on Iris Dataset
- Perform PCA on the iris dataset, reducing the number of dimensions to two.
- Explain the purpose of the analysis and present the results.
